Google indexing API

The Indexing API allows any site owner to directly notify Google when job posting pages are added or removed. This allows Google to schedule job postings for a fresh crawl, which can lead to higher quality user traffic. Currently, the Indexing API can only be used to crawl job posting pages with job posting structured data. For websites with many short-lived pages like job postings, the Indexing API keeps job postings fresh in search results because it allows updates to be pushed individually.
